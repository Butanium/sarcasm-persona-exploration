  Phase 1 replication: Testing whether sarcasm character training encodes
  different aspects at different layer depths.

  Hypothesis: Different layer ranges contribute different aspects of the
  sarcasm "character" - early layers encode humor/wit, middle-early encode
  exaggeration, middle encode cynicism, late layers provide polish.
